# Next.js App Template

## Built With

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Rendering Library
-   [Yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Package Manager
-   [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org/) - Type Checker
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Linter
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Formatter

## Installation

### Step 1

Install the needed packages:

```bash
$ yarn
```

### Step 2

When prompted...

-   Allow VSCode to use the workspace version of TypeScript
-   Allow ESLint to use the workspace version of ESLint

The previous things don't support Yarn 2's [Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) system yet, so Yarn must wrap them to be compatible.

## Usage

### Development

Just open a spare terminal and run:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

That's it, your site is available at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) and will automatically update live with any changes you make.

### Production

First build the project, this will likely take longer then usual due to release only optimizations:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

Then, after your build is ready, you can start in production with:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Visit [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) again to see your new webapp in release mode.
